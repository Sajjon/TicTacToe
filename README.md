# TicTacToe

## Play

```sh
swift run TicTacToe new
```

Which starts the game, presenting this beautiful ascii graphics:

```bash
Turn: playerX

-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
-------------
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
-------------
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
-------------

Which index? >
```

And since this is the most pointless game in the history of games, get used to seeing the draw result.

```bash
Turn: playerO

-------------
| ✖ | ◯ | ✖ |
-------------
| ◯ | ✖ | ◯ |
-------------
| ◯ | ✖ | ✖ |
-------------

playerX won!
```
